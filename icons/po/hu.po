"Tanglet is a single player word finding game based on Boggle. The object of "
"the game is to list as many words as you can before the time runs out. There "
"are several timer modes that determine how much time you start with, and if "
"you get extra time when you find a word."

"You can join letters horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in any "
"direction to make a word, so as long as the letters are next to each other "
"on the board. However, you can not reuse the same letter cells in a single "
"word. Also, each word must be at least three letters on a normal board, and "
"four letters on a large board."
