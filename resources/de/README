The letters used for German are the ASCII letters. German umlauts and eszett
are replaced by their two-letter substitutions (ae, oe, ue, ss). Diacritics in
words derived from foreign languages are dropped.

The rules what words are legal should roughly follow the rules in Scrabble,
which means that names, proper nouns, toponyms, abbreviations and archaic
words are not allowed. Dated words are ok, also regional words as long as
they are known to some extent outside the region. Extreme cases of obscenities
should be omitted. If in doubt, it is better to include words, because false
positives are better for Tanglet's gameplay than false negatives.

For easier maintenance, there is a blacklist file that can be used to filter
out unwanted words from a file with new word candidates.

The word list and blacklist are far from being complete and still contain
a lot of mistakes. Any help for improving them is appreciated.
